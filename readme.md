## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### The icons are now showing! ###
Make sure that your active theme is using the default walker for displaying the nav menu. If it's using its own custom walker, make sure that the menu item titles are filterable (please consult your theme author about this).

### The icon positions don't look right ###
If you're comfortable with editing your theme stylesheet, then you can override the styles from there.
Otherwise, I recommend you to use the [Simple Custom CSS plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/)

### Is this plugin extendable? ###
**Certainly!**

Here's how you can remove an icon type from your plugin/theme:
```php
function myplugin_remove_menu_icons_type( $types ) {
	unset( $types['genericon'] );
	return $types;
}
add_filter( 'menu_icons_types', 'myplugin_remove_menu_icons_type' );
```

To add a new icon type, take a look at the `type-*.php` files inside the `includes` directory of this plugin.

### Can you please add X icon font? ###
Let me know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kucrut/wp-menu-icons/issues) and I'll see what I can do.


## Other Notes ##

### Extra Stylesheet ###
By default, this plugin loads an extra stylesheet to make the icons display nicely on the menus.
If you don't desire this and would like your theme/plugin to handle it instead, simply do the following:
```php
add_filter( 'menu_icons_load_extra_style', '__return_false' );
```
